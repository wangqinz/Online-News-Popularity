# Online News Popularity

* Last two decades have witnessed the development of technology. With the spread of the Internet, reading habit have changed: more and more people are willing to read articles online. Journalism is one of the industries that are significantly influenced by the technology. There are lots of news websites online, including different types of news. A case in point is Mashable, a global, multi-platform online news website. In this project, my main focus is to help authors from Mashable to determine whether their new articles will be popular or not. To be more specific, almost all authors want their articles to be tagged as "hot" or "popular". And I am going to create a classifier to predict popularity by analyzing and finding several most significant predictors so that those authors are able to increase the likelihood of popularity before publishing.

* The goal is to predict which news articles will be popular and which features are most useful for predicting popularity.
